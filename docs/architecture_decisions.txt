The original Monolithic app is splitinto five modules using three message passing techniques REST API, gRPC and Distributed Message Queuing via Apache Kafka:
1. PersonService
   	PersonService keeps user information and inracts with other modules as shown in Architecture Diagram.
2. ConnectionService
        PersonService keeps connection information and inracts with other modules as shown in Architecture Diagram.
 3. LoctionPreProssessorServices 
        LoctionPreProssessorService acts as Kafka Consumer and this data will be stored in postgres database.
 4. LocationEventService
	LocationEventService process locations sent via user device via gRPC, conserdering the volume of data sent in real life senerios and the efficiency and privacy of the binary protocol is utilised.
	It acts as kafaka producer.
5. Frontend
        This is a Recat based frontend, where the end user interacts with the UdaConnect App.

We can treat Apache Kaffka as the sixth module of the new microservices based app.
